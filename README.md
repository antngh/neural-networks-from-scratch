# neural-networks-from-scratch
A learning project, I'm using this as a way to revise and recap my old knowledge.

To make sure that I understand all aspects I am trying to rely minimally on LLMs, stackoverflow and general googling. I am trying to do as much from scratch as possible, but will need to search for the odd resource (articles or wiki pages etc). When I say from scratch, I mean using as much pure python as possible, I will try to not even use numpy and definitely not PyTorch.

I'm aiming to at least create a working MLP that is trainable with backprop, and works on some dummy dataset.

I am NOT aiming to write a full package and will not be implementing anything beyond the bare minimum required (so no batching workflows, no regularisation options, no optimiser alternatives).

I am also NOT holding this up as an example of good code, no guarantees of it being clear, efficient, maintainable, well-tested or even bug-free.

With those caveats, I'm making it public.
